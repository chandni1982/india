	<p>Mahatma Ghandi, one of the greatest freedom fighters of India. He started the satyagrah, the dandi march, the salt thingy and much more without any violence. He even went to quit his job as a lawyer in Africa just to come back to India to support it. He is very respected as he is everywhere on the internet, he has his own festival and all the money in India has his face on it.</p>
